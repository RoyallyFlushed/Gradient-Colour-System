# Gradient-Colour-System
A very simple &amp; Basic system for gradient colours

---------

This was meant to be a little fun piece of code to write while I had a spare five minutes. I decided to post it here for no particular reason other than to give it to people that were asking me for it.

I could make this so much more efficient had I actually wanted to make this properly. It works well enough for smaller things though. :P
